"""Starlings: High-performance entity resolution evaluation for Python.

Starlings revolutionises entity resolution by preserving complete resolution hierarchies
rather than forcing threshold decisions. This enables instant exploration of any
threshold and provides 10-100x performance improvements through incremental computation.

Core Innovation:
    Instead of storing fixed clusters, Starlings stores merge events that can generate
    partitions at any threshold without recomputation. This achieves O(k) incremental
    metric updates where k = affected entities.

Key Features:
    - Instant threshold exploration: O(1) cached partition access
    - Incremental metrics: 10-100x faster than recomputing from scratch
    - Memory efficient: ~60-115MB for 1M edges using RoaringBitmaps
    - Type flexible: Handles int, str, bytes keys seamlessly

Performance Characteristics:
    - Hierarchy construction: O(m log m) where m = edges
    - Threshold query: O(m) first time, O(1) cached
    - Metric updates: O(k) incremental between thresholds

Example:
    ```python
    import starlings as sl

    # Create collection from edges
    edges = [
        ("record_1", "record_2", 0.95),
        ("record_2", "record_3", 0.85),
        ("record_4", "record_5", 0.75),
    ]
    collection = sl.Collection.from_edges(edges)

    # Get partition at specific threshold
    partition = collection.at(0.8)
    print(f"Entities: {len(partition.entities)}")
    ```
